# Data2Vec
 This repository implements Data2Vec, a self-supervised learning framework capable of processing speech, vision, and text using a unified model. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on modality-specific objectives, Data2Vec learns contextualized representations by predicting latent representations of the input.
